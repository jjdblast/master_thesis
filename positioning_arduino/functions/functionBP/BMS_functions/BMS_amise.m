function [ AMISE ] = BMS_amise(X, H)
%BMS_AMISE Bandwidth Matrix Selection using AMISE
%   AMISE: Asymptotic mean integrated squared error
%   H = BMS_amise(X, H)
%   X must be a vector: [x1, x2, ... xn]^T
%   And each component xi must be another vector: [xi1 xi2 .. xid]
%   H is the initial bandwidth (Silverman is recommended)
